Welcome to my homepage!  I am a phd student at the University of Oslo, and my
primary research interests are numerical modelling, CFD and sensor electronics. My CFD solver of choice is
[Basilisk C](http://www.basilisk.fr), and you can find some of my (more or less functional) code at [my sandbox](basilisk.fr/sandbox/larswd/README). I also sometimes code different projects, which can be found at [my github](github.com/larswd). 

## News and noteworthy events
